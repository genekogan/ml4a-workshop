# TensorFlow.js Example: Transfer learning + classification

This example shows you how to predict poses from a webcam using transfer
learning.  It is a modified example of the [webcam-transfer-learning example of Tensrflow.js](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/webcam-transfer-learning), using a pretrained [MobileNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/mobilenet) model.
